In some test cases the behavior of the grader is adaptive. This means that in these test cases the grader does not have a fixed sequence of mushroom species. Instead, the answers given by the grader may depend on the prior calls to \t{use\_machine}. Though, it is guaranteed that the grader answers in such a way that after each interaction there is at least one sequence of mushroom species consistent with all the answers given so far.

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers: $N$ and $R$. 

The next line of input contains two space-separated integers that specify the X and Y coordinates of Farmer Don's location inside the fence.

The rest of the input file describes the $R$ rocks: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Rock $i$'s description starts with a line containing a single integer $p_i$ ($3 \leq p_i \leq 20$), the number of vertices in the rock's base.

\item Each of the next $p_i$ lines contains a space-separated pair of integers that are the X and Y coordinates of a vertex. The vertices of a rock's base are distinct and given in counterclockwise order.
\end{itemize}

The first line contains one integer $N$: the number of vertices of the polygon $P$. The following $N$ lines describe the vertices in a counter-clockwise order, one vertex per line. Line $I+1$ (for $I = 1, 2, \ldots, N$) contains two integers $X_I$ and $Y_I$, separated by a space: coordinates of the $I$-th vertex of the polygon. All input coordinates are non-negative integers.

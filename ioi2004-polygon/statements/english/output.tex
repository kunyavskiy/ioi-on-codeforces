The output format is similar to the input format. The first line is to contain one integer $N_A$: the number of vertices in $A$ ($2 \le N_A \le 4$). The following $N_A$ lines describe the vertices of $A$ in counter-clockwise order, one vertex per line. Line $I+1$ (for $I = 1, 2, \ldots, N_A)$ contains two integers $X$ and $Y$, separated by a space: the coordinates of the $I$-th vertex of polygon $A$. 

Line $N_A+2$ should contain one integer $N_B$: the number of vertices in $B$, ($2 \le N_B$). The following $N_B$ lines describe the vertices of $B$ in counter-clockwise order, one vertex per line. Line $N_A+J+2$ (for $J = 1, 2, \ldots, N_B$) contains two integers $X$ and $Y$, separated by a space: the coordinates of the $J$-th vertex of polygon $B$.

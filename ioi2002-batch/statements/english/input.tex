Your program reads from standard input. 

The first line contains the number of jobs $N$ $(1 \le N \le 10\,000)$.

The second line contains the batch setup time $S$ which is an integer, $(0 \le S \le 50)$.

The following $N$ lines contain information about the jobs $1, 2, \ldots, N$ in that order as follows.
First on each of these lines is an integer $T_i$ $(1 \le T_i \le 100)$, the processing time of the job.
Following that, there is an integer $F_i$ $(1 \le F_i \le 100)$, the cost factor of the job.

No partial credit will be given on test cases for which no sequence of commands exists. Partial credit for other test cases will be given as described below.

\textbf{Correctness: 20\% of points}

The output file for a test case is considered correct if it is correctly formatted, contains no more than 10000 commands, and the sequence of commands causes the robots to exit the mazes, with the last command causing at least one robot to exit its maze.

\textbf{Minimality: 80\% of points}

The output file for a test case is considered minimal if it is correct and there is no shorter sequence of commands that is correct. A program whose sequence of commands is not minimal will receive no points for minimality.

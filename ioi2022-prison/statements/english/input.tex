The sample grader reads the input in the following format:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  line $1$: $N$ ($2 \le N \le 5000$)
\item line $2 + k$ ($0 \le k$): $A[k] \; B[k]$
\item last line: $-1$

\end{itemize}

Each line except the first and the last one represents a scenario.
We refer to the scenario described in line $2 + k$ as scenario $k$.
In scenario $k$ bag A contains $A[k]$ coins and bag B contains $B[k]$ coins.

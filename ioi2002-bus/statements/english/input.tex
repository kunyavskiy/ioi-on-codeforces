Your program is to read from standard input. 

The first line contains one positive integer $N$ $(2 \le N \le 500)$, the number of bus stops. 

Each of the remaining $N$ lines contains the $x$-coordinate followed by the $y$-coordinate of a bus stop.
The $x$- and $y$-coordinates are positive integers $\le 5000$.
No two bus stops are at the same location.

Scoring of each test case will be based on correctness and optimality of the TOM program given.

\textbf{Correctness: 20\% of points}

A TOM program is correct if it performs no more than 131 consecutive S-operations and the sequence of values printed by it is correct (contains exactly $N+1$ integers, starting at $N$ and ending at $0$). If any S-operation causes a register to overflow, the TOM program is considered incorrect.

\textbf{Optimality: 80\% of points}

Optimality of a correct TOM program is measured by the maximum number of consecutive S-operations in the program, which should be as small as possible. Scoring will be based on the difference between your TOM program and the best known TOM program.

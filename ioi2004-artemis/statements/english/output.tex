The output is to contain one line with two integers $I$ and $J$ separated by one space: Artemis should use the $I$-th tree (with position given on line $I+2$ of the input file) and $J$-th tree (with position given on line $J+2$ of the input file) as the corners of the area for cutting trees. The order of these two number is irrelevant. There may be several ways to choose these trees and you need to find and output one of them. For all test cases at least one solution exists.

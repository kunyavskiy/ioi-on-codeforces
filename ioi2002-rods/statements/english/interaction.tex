The first line of input contains single integer $N$ ($5 \le N \le 10000$). 

Next series of interactions happens. 

If your solution wants to examine rectangle $[a,b] \times [c,d]$ line \t{? a b c d} should be printed. In response you would be able to read integer 1 if this rectangle contains at least on points of any rod, and zero otherwise. You can use this query no more than 400 times. 

If you solution wants to report found rods, it should print \t{! r1 c1 r2 c2 p1 q1 p2 q2} where ROD1 is $<(r1, c1), (r2, c2)>$ and ROD2 is $<(p1, q1), (p2, q2)>$. After sending this query solution must terminate.

Do not forget to flush output after each query.
